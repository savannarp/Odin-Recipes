    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>"We live in St. Louis where we have fabulous Italian food," says meyerrachelle. "This lasagna could've come from any of the well-known restaurants in our area. My family was raving about it! The sauce is absolutely amazing! This is definitely a keeper! It lives up to its name."</p>
    <p>"The sweet Italian sausage and ground beef combo along with the sauce were very flavorful," says one Allrecipes community member. "Yeah it may take a while but it is so worth it. Team it with garlic bread and a salad and you'll be very satisfied."</p>
    <p>"Absolutely phenomenal," raves Amanda Simopoulos. "Fair warning: once you've made this, going back to a frozen lasagna will be impossible. It is somewhat time consuming but not difficult. My house smells delectable every time I make it!</p>

        <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
        <li> ½ cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>¾ cup</li> 
        <li>grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Enjoy!</h4>
