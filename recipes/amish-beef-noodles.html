   <hr>

   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>2 1/2 pounds beef chuck, cut into 2-inch cubes</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more for the top</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    <li>2 large yellow onions, sliced</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 rounded tablespoon beef bouillon paste</li>
    <li>8 cups beef broth, divided</li>
    <li>12 ounces large egg noodles</li>
    <li>sliced green onions for garnish (optional)</li>
   </ul>

   <h3>Directions</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>Toss beef with salt and pepper until evenly coated.</li>
    <li>Heat vegetable oil on high heat in a Dutch oven. Brown the beef thoroughly on both sides, doing half at a time, and remove to a bowl. Turn off heat.</li>
    <li>Add butter to Dutch oven, along with onions and a pinch of salt. Turn heat to medium-high, and cook, stirring, until onions turn golden, about 5 minutes. </li>
    <li>Add flour, and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes more. Add garlic powder, beef base, and beef broth. Stir, and wait for broth to come to a boil. Add reserved beef back in. </li>
    <li>Stir, and cover, and reduce heat to low. Simmer until meat is very tender, about 2 hours. </li>
    <li>Use a strainer to remove beef to a bowl and reserve. Bring both to a boil on high heat, and add noodles. Cook, stirring, until the noodles are almost tender about 30-60 seconds less than package directions. Stir in beef and reduce heat to low.</li>
    <li>Once noodles are tender and beef is heated through, taste and adjust seasoning. Serve immediately topped with more freshly ground black pepper and green onions.</li>
   </ol>

   <h4>Enjoy!</h4>
